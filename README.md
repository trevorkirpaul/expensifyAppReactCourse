# Learning React

I'm following along a course from Andrew Mead about React. I've done a few tutorials, such as `Road To Learning React` and a very simple toDo app from a Medium article. 

This course it much more involved adn starts from the basics. I'm really understading a lot and React is amzing so far! 

I've decided to create a repo for it just to highlight my learning experience whiles doing this course. It might take some time and I think watching my progress is a great indication of my journey learning React.

I originally started on Nov 1 2017 and it's Nov 4 2017 as I initially create this repo.

This course is huge and eventually covers Redux, which I am definitely looking forward to.

So far I've gotten way fmore comfortable with Babel, as in I'm actually using it very frequently to convert JSX to 'es5'.

The more I learn about React the more excited I get to actually create something big and I definitely can't wait. I might make a few small apps here and there but after this I plan on getting more familiar with Express and Node. I create dev servers on my own all day long in Nodebut that's pretty basic. My ultimate goal to to create a couple rubust MERN apps for my portfolio. 

Thanks for reading!
